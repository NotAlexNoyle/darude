darude JavaScript Engine
=============

darude is a minimal set of v8 headers hacked together to get sandstorm to build from source. The full package is available as [Haboob](https://github.com/NotAlexNoyle/Haboob).

V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine.

V8 implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262.
